/* eslint-disable no-undef --
   This script runs as a `postinstall` hook directly via `node` — not through
   the TypeScript build — so it cannot rely on any compile-time setup. It uses
   Node built-in globals (`process`, `console`) that the project-wide ESLint
   config does not yet declare in `languageOptions.globals`. The eslint
   tightening tracked alongside the broader refactor (see docs/DESIGN.md) will
   add a Node env; until then, suppress at the file scope rather than
   per-line. */

/**
 * Postinstall platform preflight for `godot-mcp`.
 *
 * Why this exists: native deps (`better-sqlite3`, `sqlite-vec`,
 * `@huggingface/transformers`) lack prebuilt binaries on some platforms — most
 * notably Alpine/musl and Windows-on-ARM (see DESIGN.md § Native dependencies
 * for the full matrix). Without a preflight, users hit cryptic gyp/source-build
 * errors during `npm install`. This script runs at the *end* of install
 * (postinstall, not preinstall — see ADR note in the issue thread) and exits
 * non-zero with a remediation pointer if the platform is unsupported.
 *
 * Two-pieces design:
 *
 *   1. `checkPlatform(input)` — a *pure* function that takes
 *      `{ platform, arch, libc }` and returns `{ supported, reason?,
 *      remediation? }`. Easy to unit-test; no I/O, no env reads.
 *
 *   2. `runCli()` — the side-effecting wrapper that collects real platform
 *      info (with env-var overrides for tests + the CI intentional-failure
 *      job), prints to stderr, and `process.exit`s. Calls `checkPlatform`
 *      under the hood.
 *
 * The runtime branches off env vars `GODOT_MCP_PREFLIGHT_*` rather than
 * positional argv so npm's automatic postinstall invocation Just Works.
 *
 * ESM module: `package.json` declares `"type": "module"`. Imported by tests as
 * `import { checkPlatform } from "../scripts/preinstall-check.js"`; invoked
 * directly by npm as `node scripts/preinstall-check.js`.
